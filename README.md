## The Philosopher-Builder Vision

> Great leaps in science and technology came from people who refuse to accept inertia... The types of people we need—philosopher-builders—and their inquiry and entrepreneurial endeavors won't happen in a vacuum.

Inquiry has always been supported by institutional structures that facilitate collaborative investigation: from Aristotle's Lyceum, to Franklin's Junto, to the Republic of Letters. The Academy follows in this tradition—creating spaces where deep questioning and practical building occur in concert.

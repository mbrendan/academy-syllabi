## The Crisis of American Higher Education

The American University system is at a crossroads. Rising tuition costs, together with falling job prospects for graduates, have made it harder than ever for students to justify a college degree. The politicization of college education on both sides of the political spectrum has made universities seem absurd in the eyes of the general public. Even graduates of elite universities no longer trust the quality of graduates from their own institutions, where an A has become the most common grade.

At this nadir of public trust, universities face unprecedented financial pressure. Research funding from the government, which had long made the American research university the envy of the world, is now more uncertain than ever. Universities with multi-billion dollar endowments have taken on vast amounts of debt to build projects of dubious educational value, while their endowments are locked in under-performing private investments.

## Institutional Conservatism vs. Radical Reform

**Radicals** say that the American university's usefulness has come to an end. The institutions are too rotten to warrant saving. It is time to start a new age of American education, focused on new institutions and new paradigms.

**Conservatives** say that the American university can be saved. We should not so quickly abandon institutions which have played a pivotal role in a period of unprecedented American prosperity, innovation, and growth. Better to patch up the old than to start fresh.

I am an **institutional, Burkean conservative**. I believe there is a lot of good in universities, and that it is more promising to effect smaller changes in existing institutions than to try to build a system from first principles, from the ground up.

Some of my fellow institutional conservatives, especially at elite universities, think nothing is wrong. They say that the Trump administration has arbitrarily and unfairly attacked a functioning university system. I disagree. The erosion of public trust in the university began long before President Trump was elected. Saving it requires serious thought about the point and value of university education in the modern world.

## The Problem: Universities Have Lost Their Core Mission

The problems of higher-education are multi-faceted, and the solution must be multi-faceted, as well. Grade-inflation will require a different solution than the current institutional arrangement, where a "non-profit" is beholden to the managers of its attached hedge fund.

But in my view **one core problem is that universities have lost sight of their core mission**. They no longer provide the good of education that is their reason for being.

## The American Liberal Arts Tradition

The American university system distinctively emphasizes four-year "liberal arts" degrees. In much of Europe, by contrast, students in four year college degrees take courses only in a single subject: mathematics, physics, history or the like. In the United States, even at "technical" institutes like MIT, students are expected to take classes outside of their specialty, across a wide array of subjects.

### Three Reasons for Liberal Arts Education

1. **Career mobility:** There is good evidence that students trained this way are more mobile later in their careers. Liberal arts education has been argued to play a causal role in the unparalleled dynamism of the American worker.

2. **Democratic citizenship:** Our tradition was inspired by a particular ideal of democratic citizenship. The university should educate leaders of our Republic. A degree holder should be trained to think clearly and carefully on any topic, humanistic or scientific, relevant to civic life in the United States.

3. **Lifelong learning:** The tradition was inspired by a vision of the human good as encompassing lifelong learning. Life is not just about your job. University education gives a student the tools for self-driven lifelong learning, wherever their own projects might lead them.

## The Decline of Structured Education

In the second half of the twentieth century, a downside emerged. As Universities opened more departments, they struggled to impose top-down structure on their degrees. A liberal arts degree had once meant a prescribed curriculum covering specific topics in each field. These requirements were gradually watered down, replaced by loose "distribution requirements." The result was that, at many schools, the ideal of a liberal education was converted into an **aimless educational miscellany**.

Today, the typical entering freshman is not given a program of study. The student might know that they want to study mathematics or physics or economics, but they are left with little guidance on how to approach the rest of the wealth of offerings at the university. Eighteen-year-olds often know a lot about the world. But they do not know what the best course of study for them will be to become democratic citizens or foster a lifelong capacity for learning.

When universities abdicated the hard work of structuring civic-minded, moral education for students, they left the field to baser incentives:
- Students began to choose the path of least resistance outside of their specialties
- Departments competed in offering ever easier introductory classes
- Distribution requirements became box-ticking exercises

The result is a course-structure that does not just appear to students to be a waste of time, but often **is** a waste of time.

## Three Models of Core Curricula

There are three models for core curricula in the United States:

### 1. Great Books Programs (St. John's, University of Austin)

Great Books as the centerpiece of a curriculum which does not offer cutting edge STEM training.

**Limitation:** STEM education is at the heart of what has helped universities contribute to American productivity in the last fifty years. We need a place to train the next generation of chemical engineers and computer scientists. Forfeiting this specialized training to industry is not a gift of efficiency to the economy—it is a loss of autonomy to the students.

### 2. MIT Model

A core curriculum in STEM but nothing else.

**Limitation:** Students who already are majoring in STEM topics will not find breadth here.

### 3. Chicago/Columbia Humanities Core

A core curriculum in the humanities and nothing else.

**Limitation:** These courses give a common language to students, but they do not give humanities majors grounding beyond their specialities.

## Proposed Solution: A Six-Course Core Curriculum

My preferred proposal would combine ideas from both sides. It would be a **core curriculum of six courses**, distributed across six departments, either to replace or to complement the current system of distribution requirements:

### The Six Courses

1. **Statistics**
   - A course in statistical reasoning and data analysis

2. **Economics**
   - A course in key ideas from both macro and micro-economics

3. **Programming and Computer Architecture**
   - A course on the basics of programming and computer architecture

4. **American Political History**
   - A course in American political history, with a focus on the constitution

5. **Moral and Political Thought**
   - A course in the classics of moral and political thought

6. **Classical Literature**
   - A course in classical literature

### Implementation

My suggestion would be that the University allow each chosen department free range to determine the content of these courses, but within limits. The courses should be designed to serve the goals mentioned above.

## Benefits of a Rigorous Core Curriculum

1. **Shared project:** Provides an opportunity to restore the sense that faculty and students at universities are engaged in a larger shared project, aimed at big common ideals.

2. **Shared language:** Gives students shared language and experience, building community and a forum for dialogue across the university.

3. **Grade accountability:** Large shared courses, rather than the chaos of individual electives, provide the possibility for third-party grading, which serves as an antidote to rampant grade inflation.

## Conclusion

A structured curriculum of well-chosen, rigorous classes could buck the current trend and restore adherence to these high values. It could help to guarantee that:
- Students are trained in ways that will aid job mobility later in life
- They are being trained to reason carefully about the choices with which they will be presented for life as a citizen of our Republic
- They are prepared for a life of self-driven learning

Choosing courses in a curriculum will be difficult, both as an intellectual problem, and also as a political, institutional one. But this difficulty must be faced. Some solution to the problem of a core curriculum is better than the current watered down and often useless requirements.

The canon wars displayed the impossibility of making a perfect, universally accepted choice of a "canon." But we must not let the perfect be the enemy of our common good. **It is a good in itself that students on each campus and across our society have a shared language of key ideas**, whether or not those are the very best courses we could design.

> The ideals of the American tradition of liberal arts education are good ones. We should not give them up too easily. But even the best ideals require constant renovation and defense. It is time to restore them.

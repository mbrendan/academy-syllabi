# Liberty Fund Colloquium: AI and the Republic of Science

**Format:** Colloquium
**Duration:** 3 sessions
**Location:** Austin, TX
**Partners:** Liberty Fund and Cosmos Institute

---

## Overview

This colloquium explores the relationship between scientific knowledge, method, and progress—from Aristotle's foundations through Bacon's revolutionary program to Polanyi's republic of science. How do we know what we know? What is the proper organization of scientific inquiry? And what are the implications for AI development?

## Syllabus

### Session 1: Aristotle and Bacon on Scientific Knowledge

**Part A: Aristotle — Foundations of Scientific Knowledge**

**Reading:** Aristotle, *Posterior Analytics* II.19 (99b20–100b15)

Aristotle insists that demonstration (*apodeixis*) cannot go on forever; it must rest on self-evident starting points grasped by *nous* (intuitive intellect).

**Key Themes:**
- Science as knowledge of the necessary through causes
- Induction (*epagōgē*): perception → memory → experience → universal concept
- The four causes: formal, final, efficient, material
- *Episteme* as timeless, certain, and explanatory knowledge

**Contrasts:**
- **Bacon:** Rejects self-evident axioms; first principles must be discovered inductively from experience, not given by intuition
- **Popper:** All knowledge is conjectural and open to falsification; what Aristotle treats as certain, Popper treats as provisional

**Part B: Bacon — The New Organon**

**Reading:** Bacon, *Novum Organum*, selected aphorisms (pp. 143–172)

Bacon recasts science as humanity's means to regain dominion over nature—"instauration" as restoring the human condition.

**Key Themes:**

**The "marriage of the empirical and rational faculties"** (p. 157)
- Unites scholastic logic (reason) and craft/experiment
- The birth of modern empiricism—science as teamwork between data and theory

**Aphorism 41: "The mind is an uneven mirror"** (p. 165)
- Our senses and reasoning misreport reality
- Only methodical experiment and instruments can purify them
- Anticipates experimental control, peer review, psychology of bias

**Critique of Aristotelian logic** (pp. 155–166)
- Syllogism "starts from arbitrary first principles"
- Reasoning must follow observation, not precede it
- Dethronement of scholastic authority

**The collective model of knowledge** (pp. 162–170)
- Discovery should be systematic and cumulative—"the compass" replacing the "naked eye"
- Prefigures the Royal Society, modern research universities, Big Science

**The shift from contemplative wisdom to productive power** (p. 172)
- Truth measured by works, not by harmony with the cosmos
- Goodness equals utility

### Session 2: Bacon's New Atlantis and the Politics of Science

**Reading:** Bacon, *New Atlantis* (pp. 114–139)

**Key Questions:**
- Is Solomon's House a utopia or dystopia?
- The sailors' admiration vs. the eerie control of the Fathers
- Science as both salvation and subtle domination

**Key Themes:**

**The "miracle of light"** (pp. 114–116)
- Manufactured revelation? The politics of knowledge?
- The Fathers decide what to reveal "for the good of others"—benevolent technocracy vs. open inquiry

**"Humanity" as Bensalem's chief virtue** (pp. 117–120)
- Yet their humanity seems manufactured: "they have no lust," "they're like angels"
- Bacon's ideal citizen is peaceful, chaste, and utterly non-political

**Post-political order** (pp. 117–139)
- With abundance and stability, the need for law, trade, and contest vanishes
- "Politics gives way to administration"
- Bensalem abolishes the conditions of virtue

**Science without stated limits** (pp. 128–139)
- The scientists can "resuscitate the dead," "manipulate weather," "breed animals"
- But no reflection on ends
- The closing prayer leaves the problem of ends unresolved—still the problem of modernity

### Session 3: Polanyi and the Republic of Science

**Reading:** Michael Polanyi, "The Republic of Science" (1962)

**Key Themes:**

**Polycentric order**
- Rejects both central control (Soviet-style planning) and pure individualism
- Many centers pursuing truth yet checking one another

**Personal knowledge** (§3–4)
- Science depends on faith in standards, mentors, and traditions
- A moral commitment to truth
- Challenges the positivist myth of objectivity as detachment

**Authority and liberty** (§4–5)
- "Authority in science is essential for its liberty"
- Deference to expertise enables independence
- The young scientist's apprenticeship transmits standards that make free discovery possible

**Passion and reason** (§3)
- "A passionate desire to know... is the mainspring of science"
- Love of truth, wonder, and beauty orient inquiry

**The tacit dimension**
- "We know more than we can tell"
- Scientific reasoning depends on skills, intuitions, and pattern recognition that can't be fully codified

**Against central planning** (§7)
- "A centrally directed research system would paralyze discovery"
- Writing against Soviet "Lysenkoism"—the politicization of biology
- Science thrives only where freedom to err is protected

**The moral act of knowing**
- A scientist must *care* about truth
- Must *commit* to honesty, precision, and humility
- Must *trust* the community of peers and take responsibility for claims
- Epistemology (how we know) and Ethics (how we ought to live) are continuous

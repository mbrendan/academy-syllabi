## Syllabus

### Session 1: Foundations of Scientific Knowledge

#### Part A: Aristotle — *Posterior Analytics* II.19 (99b20–100b15)

Aristotle insists that demonstration (*apodeixis*) cannot go on forever; it must rest on self-evident starting points grasped by *nous* (intuitive intellect).

**Key Themes:**

**Safeguarding science from infinite regress**
- The intellect (*nous*) apprehends axioms immediately—for instance, "the whole is greater than the part"
- Science then deduces consequences from them

**Induction (*epagōgē*)**
- Repeated perception → memory → experience → universal concept
- This is Aristotle's proto-empirical epistemology
- *Epagōgē* is not Bacon's bottom-up data crunching; it's the mind recognizing form within particulars
- Contemporary cognitive science re-introduces Aristotelian induction as pattern abstraction—machine learning is, ironically, neo-Aristotelian here

**The Four Causes**
- Formal (what gives something its form/essence)
- Final (what it is for—its purpose)
- Efficient (what produces it)
- Material (what something is made of)
- Bacon rejects final causes as sterile; knowledge should serve power, not essence
- Modern science explains functionally (how), not essentially (why)

**Episteme**
- Aristotle defines science as knowledge of the necessary through causes; it's timeless, certain, and explanatory
- Contrast with Bacon: Science becomes progressive and contingent—the aim is mastery, not immutable truth

**Contrasts:**
- **Bacon:** Rejects self-evident axioms; first principles must be discovered inductively from experience, not given by intuition. Bacon's method is an anti-Aristotelian reboot of how first principles are formed.
- **Popper:** Flips the Aristotelian logic entirely. There are no indubitable starting points; all knowledge is conjectural and open to falsification. What Aristotle treats as certain, Popper treats as provisional hypotheses.

#### Part B: Bacon — *Novum Organum* (selected aphorisms)

Bacon recasts science as humanity's means to regain dominion over nature—"instauration" as restoring the human condition before the Fall.

**Key Themes:**

**Science as redemption (pp. 143–147)**
- Scientific inquiry as a redemptive act—reversing the damage of original sin by recovering Adam's original knowledge
- This theological-scientific fusion seeds the Enlightenment dream of progress: knowledge as salvation, science as a second creation
- Critique: Augustine and Pascal would call this blasphemous—the Fall was moral, not intellectual; it cannot be reversed by tools
- Heidegger later claims Bacon's vision inaugurates the "age of enframing" (*Gestell*), where being itself becomes a resource to be optimized

**"Marriage of the empirical and rational faculties" (p. 157)**
- Bacon's Prayer: "true and lawful marriage between the empirical and the rational"
- Unites scholastic logic (reason) and craft/experiment
- The birth of modern empiricism—science as teamwork between data and theory, not solitary genius
- Critique: Galileo and Newton show that mathematics, not just induction, bridges theory and reality—Bacon undervalues abstract modeling

**Aphorism 41: "The mind is an uneven mirror" (p. 165)**
- Our senses and reasoning misreport reality; only methodical experiment and instruments can purify them
- Anticipates experimental control, peer review, and the psychology of bias
- Every instrument also mediates and distorts; do we ever escape the mirror?
- Kuhn and Latour show that even scientific "corrections" are socially constructed; method doesn't purify bias, it reorganizes it

**Critique of Aristotelian logic (pp. 155–166)**
- Syllogism "starts from arbitrary first principles"
- Reasoning must follow observation, not precede it
- Dethronement of scholastic authority; launches the experimental method
- Critique: Aristotle's logic aimed at understanding being, not building gadgets. Bacon's "true induction" may still rely on hidden metaphysics

**The collective model of knowledge (pp. 162–170)**
- Discovery should be systematic and cumulative—"the compass" replacing the "naked eye"
- Prefigures the Royal Society, modern research universities, Big Science
- The template for modern institutions of research and peer review: science as a republic, not a monologue
- Critique: Great leaps often come from the lone intuitive dissenter whom Bacon's bureaucracy would ignore

**The shift from contemplative wisdom to productive power (p. 172)**
- Truth measured by works, not by harmony with the cosmos; goodness equals utility
- Foundation of utilitarian ethics, industrial progress, and technocratic policy
- This turns ethics into engineering; the question "Should we?" vanishes into "Can we?"

### Session 2: The Politics of Science

#### Part A: Bacon — *New Atlantis* (pp. 114–139)

**Key Questions:**
- Is Solomon's House a utopia or dystopia?
- The sailors' admiration vs. the eerie control of the Fathers
- Science as both salvation and subtle domination

**Key Themes:**

**The "miracle of light" (pp. 114–116)**
- The "Pillar of light" episode and the arrival of the ark
- Miracle was likely staged by Solomon's House, since they already had the Bible and the technology to produce such phenomena
- The scientists "play God" by scripting revelation—a managed fusion of faith and science
- Manufactured revelation? The politics of knowledge?

**"Humanity" as Bensalem's chief virtue (pp. 117–120)**
- Yet their humanity seems manufactured: "they have no lust," "they're like angels," "sheep people"
- Bacon's ideal citizen is peaceful, chaste, and utterly non-political—a population engineered for docility
- The Bensalemites' "humanity" masks total obedience

**Post-political order (pp. 117–139)**
- With abundance and stability, the need for law, trade, and contest vanishes—"politics gives way to administration"
- Bacon imagines a post-political order: no scarcity, no war, no deliberation
- Science, not virtue, organizes society
- Bensalem abolishes the conditions of virtue

**Science without stated limits (pp. 128–139)**
- The scientists can "resuscitate the dead," "manipulate weather," "breed animals"—but without reflection on ends
- The closing prayer ("for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate") leaves the problem of ends unresolved—still the problem of modernity
- House of Solomon = knowing ordered toward power, not knowing for the sake of virtue

**Popper's critique:**
- Bensalem's secrecy (the Fathers decide what to reveal "for the good of others") prefigures the "closed society"—benevolent technocracy rather than open inquiry

---

#### Part B: Polanyi — "The Republic of Science" (1962)

**Key Themes:**

**Polycentric order**
- Rejects both central control (Soviet-style planning) and pure individualism
- The republic of science is polycentric—many centers pursuing truth yet checking one another

**Personal knowledge (§3–4)**
- "We must recognize belief as the foundation of knowledge"
- Science depends on faith in standards, mentors, and traditions—a moral commitment to truth
- Challenges the positivist myth of objectivity as detachment; genuine discovery requires passionate involvement
- Prefigures virtue epistemology and the contemporary emphasis on trust, integrity, and community norms

**Authority and liberty (§4–5)**
- "Authority in science is essential for its liberty"
- Deference to expertise enables independence; the young scientist's apprenticeship transmits standards that make free discovery possible
- Dissolves the Enlightenment antinomy between reason and tradition—every discovery presupposes a fiduciary chain of trust

**Passion and reason (§3)**
- "A passionate desire to know... is the mainspring of science"
- Reason is energized by passion; love of truth, wonder, and beauty orient inquiry more deeply than detached calculation

**The tacit dimension**
- "We know more than we can tell"
- Scientific reasoning depends on skills, intuitions, and pattern recognition that can't be fully codified

**The moral act of knowing**
- Polanyi reintroduces the moral and psychological dimensions of the knower—character, virtue, trust, emotion, and purpose—into epistemology
- A scientist must *care* about truth
- Must *commit* to honesty, precision, and humility
- Must *trust* the community of peers and take responsibility for claims
- Epistemology (how we know) and Ethics (how we ought to live) are continuous

**Against central planning (§7)**
- "A centrally directed research system would paralyze discovery"
- Writing against Soviet "Lysenkoism"—the politicization of biology
- Science thrives only where freedom to err is protected

# Oxford 2025: AI x Philosophy Seminar

**Format:** Academic seminar
**Duration:** 8 weeks (Trinity Term 2025)
**Location:** University of Oxford
**Instructors:** Philipp Koralus (HAI Lab) and Brendan McCord (Cosmos Institute)

---

## Overview

Co-delivered by Professor Philipp Koralus, Director of the Laboratory for Human-Centered AI (HAI Lab) at the University of Oxford, and Brendan McCord, Chair of the Cosmos Institute, this seminar brings together leading thinkers from philosophy and the cutting edge of AI development.

Each week, distinguished visitors from organizations including Midjourney, Google DeepMind, Prime Intellect, Apple, and academia engage with seminar participants in substantive dialogue about how we might embed human flourishing into the global technology development pipeline from first principles.

From truth-seeking AI systems to collective intelligence, from privacy concerns to democratic deliberation, we explore how philosophical frameworks can guide the development of technologies that enhance rather than diminish human autonomy.

**Independent project opportunity:** Grants awarded to select students for independent summer building projects on related themes via Cosmos Institute's fast grants program.

## Moderator Feedback

- "Great system for including people. People spoke mostly about their experiences and not as much about the text."
- "I would have enforced the two minute rule, and required people to be more responsive to the moderator's questions or one another. There was a lot of commentary that didn't move the ball forward."
- "My sense is the room leaned optimist towards AI but with caveats and concerns. I think this was sufficient divergence for good conversation but something to consider."
- "Given the breadth of topics and knowledge in the room, defining terms and providing foundational context would have helped more and we adapted by day three."
- "Our session was a bit different because one of the authors of one of our readings was a seminar participant, as were the moderator's immediate colleagues. It made for a very tangible discussion on the last day, so it was a strength."
- "I'm not sure I have anything to suggest to Brendan… he's a very strong moderator. The only thing I can think of is that our optional readings were not included in our PDF, which was disappointing as some were hard to get."

## Participant Takeaways

- "Read the classics."
- "An expectation that AI research shops invest in and use philosophy to guide decision making."
- "I like the Bostrom/Andreessen pairing - would be great for grad students."
- "Ways of looking at challenge of agency and thinking about how to think about when to apply AI tools and when not, better ability to ask technical and fundamental questions as we build tools."
- "I have a fuller context now for aspects of my work and some philosophical frameworks to consider."
- "More of my learning has undoubtedly been about philosophy, and there's no doubt that I will be able to use that in my work, although exactly how remains to be seen!"

## Facilitation Insights

**What worked:**
- Name tag flip system for indicating desire to speak
- Bostrom/Andreessen pairing as readings
- Having an author of one reading as a participant (tangible discussion)

**Areas for improvement:**
- Enforce two-minute speaking rule more strictly
- Define terms and provide foundational context earlier
- Ensure optional readings are included in PDF packet
- Consider diversity of perspectives in participant selection

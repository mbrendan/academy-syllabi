## Most Valuable Takeaways

- "The seminar series opened my mind to this in a way I hadn't even imagined beforehand, and led me to seriously reevaluate my career decisions and interests; I am now very focused on working on AI."
- "The ripeness of philosophical, technological, and social scientific commentaries on these questions when combined."
- "Very structured and first principles philosophy concepts — I have not had formal learning in philosophy, and I found this series to be exceptional and elucidating key concepts relevant to the talks."
- "That there is an ethical component that must be preserved."
- "Deeper understanding of fundamental considerations around the design and impact of AI."
- "I learned how to think about AI critically and how to view the design of technology from a human-centred perspective."
- "We need measurable ways to track the impact of these systems. Most AIs are judged on performance benchmarks but we need comprehensive views into the human element."
- "It has given me a much better understanding of the more subtle threats that AI poses to human flourishing and ways to prevent these from materialising."
- "Asking a model isn't decentralization, AI threatens to become autocomplete for life."

## Most Valuable Sessions

| Session | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Ivan Vendrov (Collective Intelligence) | "Really changed how transformative AI can be" / "Raised interesting questions around how AI can shape the collective incentive landscape" |
| Brendan's lectures | "Articulated in a very clear and foundationally constructive way the macro relationship between AI and Philosophy, especially on agency and autonomy" |
| Week 2 (Inquiry Complex demo) | "A very innovative way of using a model and the presentation gave a very clear description of how philosophical ideas can be practically developed in code" |
| Vincent (Prime Intellect) | "Showed in a very tangible way how powerful AI can/will be for innovation" |
| Habermas Machine | "A particularly interesting finding, and the presentation was clear" |

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Content & Format:**
- "A smaller group discussion component could add a lot of value for highly engaged participants."
- "Having the ability to interact with more of the seminar attendees throughout would have been great (i.e. break out groups and discourse)."
- "Clearer communication about how important it is to do the readings in advance."
- "It would have been a lot easier to process Brendan's talk if there had been slides."

**Logistics:**
- "Please send weekly email with links to readings."
- "Share a list of readings which explain how the technology of the models works on a technical level, especially for students who do not have a background in computer science."
- "More involvement from the online side."

**Community Building:**
- "It would have been helpful to have the Teams chat earlier on so that CS and Philosophy students could pair-up earlier and work on a project together."
- "Perhaps integrating more of a YC-style workshop energy would be helpful, encouraging students to connect and discuss amongst themselves."

## Vision from Participants

> "I envision a future where HAI Lab x Cosmos is a centre for UK AI startups, spinning out of Oxford and shaping the future of AI research and product development in a philosophically principled, ethics-first way. I am very excited to watch this space and I think Brendan and Phillip have gone above and beyond my expectations... connecting theory with practice in this way is brilliant, and affords a rare opportunity for people from a philosophy background, like myself, to turn their academic interests into an area of real ethical puzzles and have major impact in policy, research, and product design/implementation."
